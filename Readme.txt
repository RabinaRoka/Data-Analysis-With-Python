.head
.describe
.corr
diagonal of the correlation is equal to 1.
.shape =rows and columns

.loc = Access a group of rows and columns by supplying label(s) arguments.
.dtype : datatype
.ndim = total dimensions
.size: = total number of sizes

###Numpy
-important for data processing
-Numpy work on the top of python
-Pandas and Matplotlib work on the top of Numpy
-if n =3 .then 2 ko power n give you number of decimal numbers.

1.8 bits = 1 byte

###Numpy Array
np.array it works same as python listing
slicling : a[0:] 0 to something,
a[1:3] : 1 to 3 :1 means second position and 3means last and last doen't include so 2, 3. 

a[1:-1] = 2,3
a[1] corresponds to the element at index 1, which is 2.
a[-1] corresponds to the last element, but the slicing rule in Python excludes the element at the end of the range, so it won't include 4.
::2 = starting from 0 and skip all parts up to 2 and 2 position : 1,3
#multi indexing 

if array is inconsistent it will shows that the array is objects
